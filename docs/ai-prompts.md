perfect thank you. i have generated the image.

i have replaced the odl images with the new one.
i have given them the exact same name :

1 kiwi-salad-full.webp
2 kiwi-salad-400.webp

same path as before. just deleted the old and replace with the new.

problem : my app is still rendering the old image even if it has beed deleted from 
the public folder and replaced.
i have closed and restarted the server but it keeps rendering the old image.

note:  the images are stored locally, in the firebase database each dish ath the image link field
have the link of each locally stored images.

what do i have to to to render the new images ?
