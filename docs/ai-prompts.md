perfect, thank you.

i have a couple of questions to help me understand everything:

1 for the horizontal scrollbar :
  .no-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }
  .no-scrollbar { -ms-overflow-style: none; scrollbar-width: none; }
should i add this in the layer utilities exactly like this ?

2 about the colors of the links: the deafult text color of the entire app is orange-800.
i use it almost in every text in the app
using text-stone instead of orange is the best solution or i should keep with orange ?

2 what about the acitve bg color for the link ?
it is better to make it amber or keep with oranges ?
what about using a gradient ?
for example : bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-200 to-orange-100
